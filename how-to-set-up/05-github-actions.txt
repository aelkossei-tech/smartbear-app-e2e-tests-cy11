Pipelines:
We MUST integrate our execution for suites (Smoke, Regression, E2E, Accessibility, System Testing)

1. Set up framework locally
	Cypress: 

	POM Design pattern
	OOP Principles: Inheritance, Encapsulation

2. Link it with remote repo
	GitHub

3. Generate reports
	Mochawesome

4. Create suites
	Cypress Grep

5. Integrate with pipelines
	Automate triggers (execution)
	Increase visibility of logs to other team members
	Scheduling triggers
